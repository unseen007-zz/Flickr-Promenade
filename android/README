To compile the project you must need :
- Android Studio
- Gradle
- Maven

////////

To have the correct config files, you must :

- Add a class looking like this in package : com.unseen.flickr.promenade.utils
    You have to put your FlickR API key

public class Config {
    /** FlickR Api Key */
    public static final String FLICKR_KEY = "********";
}

- Add a xml file in the values of your resources (src/main/res/values/config.xml)
   You have to put your Google Maps API key

<resources>
    <string name="google_play_services_key">*******</string>
</resources>


/////////

Just run the application via the Android Studio launcher, or with gradle commands
