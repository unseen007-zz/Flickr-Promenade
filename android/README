To compile the project you must need :
- Android Studio
- Gradle
- Maven

////////

To have the correct config files, you must :

- Add a class looking like this in package : com.unseen.flickr.promenade.utils
    You have to put your FlickR API key

public class Config {
    /** FlickR Api Key */
    public static final String FLICKR_KEY = "********";
}

- Add a xml file in the values of your resources (src/main/res/values/config.xml)
   You have to put your Google Maps API key

<resources>
    <string name="google_play_services_key">*******</string>
</resources>


/////////

Just run the application via the Android Studio launcher, or with gradle commands

/////////

This app allows to find the closest FlickR images.

On the first screen, you'll find a list of images.
When you click on an image you have some details at the bottom of your screen.

If you click on that banner, you'll be taken to the real photo with owner, and description of the picture.

The button with the feet, creates a promenade path for you to take, to visit all waypoints.
